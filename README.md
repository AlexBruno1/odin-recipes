# odin-recipes
First project on html following TOP

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
It will require basic html, the fundamentals.

Personally i will try to use the terminal in conjunction with git as much as possible .

UPDATE AFTER COMPLETING THE PROJECT:

The project was easily achievable with the knowledge i gathered through the course until now, it's not good looking, but it works.

As we all know done it's better than perfect.
